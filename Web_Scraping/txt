The municipal corporation of Chandigarh passed a resolution on Thursday which states that the city should remain a union territory, and should also get its own legislative assembly.

The resolution also said that the union government should ask Haryana and Punjab to have their separate capital cities. Both these states share Chandigarh as their capital city and have been taking claim over the beautiful city."The public sentiment clearly says that residents were against transferring Chandigarh to Punjab and Haryana. Chandigarh has its own identity and should remain as UT and be given vidhan sabha", Chandigarh Mayor Sarabjit Kaur Dhillon said.ALSO READ: AAP seeks outside support to stake claim on Chandigarh Municipal CorporationOnly BJP councillors were present when the resolutions were passed.
